				A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly not very closer to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practise subsistence agriculture and also for some non-agricultural societies. Villages have been eclipsed in importance as units of human society and settlement. Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village was small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families. Homes were situated for sociability and defence and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. Over night stay in the village bungalow.
