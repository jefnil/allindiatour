Five elements temple !!!</br>
</p>
<p class="text-justify">Homams and Poojas are performed for a particular deity by invoking Agni, the God of fire. The Sun is considered as the main source of energy, and fire is considered as a representation of the Sun's energy. According to the ancient texts on Homams, anything offered in a Fire towards God, is actually an offer to Sun. Any such offer is done either to enrich energy or to destroy the undesirable elements in the environment, and thus, in both ways, environment is protected. Poojas, Homams are also believed to be one of the greatest rituals in Hindu religion, whereby performing this, one can get rid of any obstacles and also attain self-satisfaction. The idea of all Homams is the prosperity of the people by energizing and protecting the environment. It is told that when Lord Brahma (the creator among the Trinity) created a human, he also created Homam for human's livelihood and their attainment of desires. The main aim of Homam is derived from the Vedas or from the ancient texts of Hindus. These Vedas explain as to how a human should be, how they should be helpful to others and the good actions that they should perform. Vedas and Homam are eternal truth which have neither a beginning nor end, and are divine, not the creation of humans.</p>

<p class="text-justify">To perform any Pooja or Homam, a Priest is appointed. While performing any Pooja, the Priest or Pandit ji perform the Pooja of the Lord Ganesh as Lord Ganesh holds a unique position in the Indian culture. For any ceremony or ritual, a Pooja is performed before beginning a new venture by invoking the power of Ganesh. A Kalash (brass or copper pot filled with sacred water) is placed with a coconut and different fruits, grains and betel leaves in the front. After the Ganesh Pooja is completed, the Pooja of the respective God or Goddess and Yantra is performed on whose behalf the Homam is performed. This is done with the recitation of a Mantra for that particular deity with the offerings of water, Chandan (sandalwood) paste, Sindoor (vermilion), rice, milk mixed with floral-scented oil, flowers, fruits and sweets. After the Pooja is completed by the Priest, preparations are made for the Yagna or Homams (sacred fire ritual) to be performed. This is the last part of the Pooja and is performed for more than an hour.</p>

It is believed that by conducting poojas, prayers and rituals here on the BIRTHDAY is highly meritorious. This is the only place in the world where these birthday marriages are held every day in large numbers according to one’s Indian zodiac. Markandeya, son of sage Mrikandu was predicted to live for only 16 years. As advised by his father, Markandeya worshiped Amritaghateswarar in Thirukkadaiyur, bringing the water from the Ganges, through an underground passage to the temple. On the destined day, Yama appeared with his noose. Markandeya sought refuge with the Lord and embraced the Shiva Lingam. The Lord warned Yama not to disturb Markandeya since he was under his protection. Yama did not listen and threw the noose that bound Markandeya and the Lingam together. Angered by this rash action, the Lord kicked Yama with his left leg and held him under his left foot, making him immobile. Markandeya was blessed with an ‘ever sixteen’ boon. It is believed that Lord Shiva diminished Kalan or Yaman in Thirukadaiyur. So Lord Shiva in Thirukadaiyur is called Mritunga Jaya Murthi.</div>
<div class="text-justify">It is the only place in the world, (good or bad days) where 50-100 numbers of aged birth day marriages are celebrated on a daily basis with all rituals and formalities.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">The importance and divinity of komatha and nandhini can be heard from the story of sage, 'Viswamitra'.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Vishwamitra was a king and was known as Kaushika, the descendent of kusha dynasty. Once, Vishwamitra and his soldiers took shelter in the Ashram of Rishi Vasishta. Vasishta took care of his large army and fed his soldiers well. Vishwamitra was surprised as to how it was possible for a sage to take care and make all arrangements to feed such a large army. Vishwamitra was inquisite to understand the mystery from Vasishta. Vasishta replied that he had a divine calf Nandini, gifted by Indra. Nandini was the daughter of Indra`s cow Kamdhenu. Vishwamitra was overwhelmed to know the truth. He decided to possess that cow as he thought that a humble sage like Vasishta did not require this cow. Vishwamitra expressed his desire to sage Vasishta. Vasishta refused the proposal in a polite manner. The king was extremely angry. Vishwamitra ordered his army to seize the cow and drive it to his kingdom. Vasishta to encounter them created an army of fierce warrior with his yogic power. They fought the army of Vishwamitra and defeated them. Vishwamitra was imprisoned in the war and presented before Vasishta but the Brahmarishi Vasishta forgave him and released him with words of advice. This incident made a deep impression on King Vishwamitra. He realized that power gained by penance is much greater than the physical power of a king. He vowed to be a greater Rishi than Sage Vasishta and renounced his kingdom. By penance he took the name Vishwamitra. After severe austerity and many sacrifice Vishwamitra won the title of Brahmarishi by Vashita himself.</div>

<div class="text-justify">If a cow eats something poisonous by mistake, and we drink its milk, will we fall ill ??? To test this, the cow was regularly fed with a particular quantity of a poison every day. After 24 hours, its blood, urine, dung and milk were tested in a lab to check if the poison could be found. These tests were done continuously for 90 days in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi. The researcher did not find any trace of poison in milk, blood, urine or dung of that cow. Where did the poison fed to the cow for 90 days disappear ??? Just like Lord Shiva held poison in his throat, the gomatha hid the entire poison in her throat. No other animal has this special quality. Cow is the only creature that inhales oxygen and also exhales oxygen. Cow milk has the quality of countering poison. Urine of Go-matha has the power to cure a few diseases though medical science is yet to understand. If cow-ghee and rice are cooked together, two powerful gases called ethylene-oxide, propylene-oxide are released. Propylene-oxide is the best gas used for creating artificial rain. Cow-urine is the world’s best killer of microbes -Bacteria and Germs. Medicines made by using cow dung and cow urine, stomach-related ailments can be cured. The medical sciences says that cow-dung plastering home save from radio-waves. Cow-dung has the power to destroy the microbes – Bacteria causing cholera.If 10 grams of cow-ghee is put in fire (Yaham), 1000 kilograms of oxygen is generated. Cow-urine is as sacred as Ganga-jal</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Sidha’s heavenly paradise and thousands of Sidhargals are alive and they bless the devotees. Successive Kings of South India have given great importance to Tiruvannamalai and the temple of Arunachala. One cannot describe the atmosphere of the temple and the vibration. The variegated architectural styles of generations of kings, who built and renovated its massive gopurams and halls, the living presence of the great saints, who stayed here and sang the Lord’s praise and above all, the infinite compassion and grace of Arunachala, give this holiest of holy places, a timeless quality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">THIRUVANNAMALAI is home to Annamalaiyar Temple. Thiruvannamalai has long been associated with many yogis and siddhars. Thiruvannamalai is one of the Pancha Bootha Sthalam representing the fire element. On the day of Karthigai Deepam, a huge lamp is lit at the sunset in a cauldron with three tons of ghee at the top of the Annamalai hill. Every full moon night, thousands of pilgrims worship Lord Shiva by circumambulating the Arunachala hill barefoot. There were many hundreds of saints guru and sidhargal lived in Thiruvannamalai.</div>
<div class="text-justify">By visiting Chidambaram or by being born in Thiruvarur or by dying in Kasi or by merely thinking of Arunachala, you will surely attain Liberation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">The supreme knowledge - Self-knowledge, the import of Vedanta, which cannot be attained without great difficulty, but can easily be attained by anyone, who sees the form of this hill from wherever it is visible or who thinks of it by mentally from distance. This Magnetic hill will attract the soul forcibly. What a wonder is this !!! The soul can be saved by thinking of this great Arunagiri, which shines in the mind.</div>
<div class="text-justify">Karthigai Deepam Festival At Tiruvannamalai - Brahma and Vishnu were both quarrelling about their relative superiority. To take a decision and to erase their ego, Lord Shiva stood before them in the form of a blazing mountain. Having failed in their attempt to find out its top and bottom, the two prayed to Lord Shiva for his blessings. He blessed them saying that he would appear in the form of Jothi on top of the hill every year on the day of Karthigai Deepam during the month of Karthigai. To commemorate this event the Deepam festival is being conducted at Thiruvannamalai every year. There is literary evidence to prove that this lamp festival is one of the traditions in Tamil culture. This annual festival attract almost 2 millions visitors to Thiruvannamalai and every one go around (GRIVALAM) the hill of 14 kms by fare foot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Girivalam- the Holy Mountain of Arunachala rises up to an elevation of 2669 feet. The road encircling the mountain, where devotees circumambulate is 14 kms. On Full Moon days and on the day of Karthigai Deepam and on the first day of Tamil New Year, lakhs of devotees undertake girivalam ie., circumambulating the mountain to get the blessings of the Lord Arunachala. This hill is made up of igneous rock connected with fire, which is one of the four kinds of mountains classified by geology. So one can see the truth behind the tradition regarding the origin and formation of this hill. Our religious philosophy is based on science and there is always the combination of Vignana and Meygnana. These two are inextricably intertwined. An American Geologist has stated that Mountain: Arunachala should have been thrown up by the earth under the stress of some violent volcanic eruption in the Dark Ages before even the coal-bearing layers were formed. It existed long before the gigantic saurians of the pre-historic world, moved their ungainly forms through the prehistoric forests that covered our early earth. Arunachala is almost old and as ancient as our planetary home itself. What a miracle !!! Such a barren rock has captivated the souls of sages and saints for ages together. Legends say that Tiruvannamalai was a fire alias Agni Mountain in Krathayuga, Gold alias Swarna Mountain in Thrathayugha, Copper alias Thambra Mountain in Duvaparayuga and Rock Mountain in this Kaliyuga. Arunachala hill has a religious status in our sacred tradition. Tamil legends hold that it is far more ancient than the Himalayas, which are comparatively known to be of later origin. Arunachala is a combination of two Sanskrit words Aruna and Achala. Aruna means 'red' and Achala means ' immovable mount’, thereby known as the "Red Mount".</div>
<div class="text-justify">There are eight Lingas, eight Nandis, more than 350 tanks and many mandapams around the hill. The eight Lingams are Indira Lingams, Agni Lingam, Ema Lingam, Niruthi Lingam, Varuna Lingam, Vaayu Lingam, Kubera Lingam and Esanya Lingam. Caves In The Heart Of Arunachala, Tiruvannamalai - There are many caves in Arunachala Hill. The Puranas say so and even yogis have confirmed, that from these mysterious caves, one can watch the wonderful sights and also watch Siddhars deep in penance, oblivious to the world, content with partaking and absorbing the abundant grace of Arunachala.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Siddhars And Saints Of Tiruvannamalai- Many ancient sages from the Himalayas and other sacred places of India came to Arunachala, either on a pilgrimage or to live in its vicinity. Some of these rishis were&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Pulastya, Vasishta, Marichi, Agastya, Dadichi, Nagana, Brigu, Atri, Jabali, Jaimini, Jamadagni, Bharata, Pipalata, Kasyapa, Kumudha, Varsha, Vibandaga, Vyasa, Mandavya, Matanga, Kukshi, Mandakarni, Chandilya, Maduchandas, Gargeya, Apasthamba, Romesamuni, Bhargava, Bharadwaja, Swetaketu, Koundinya, Pundarika, Valmiki, Narada, Vahini, Bodayana, Mrukandu, Durvasa, Gangavarya, Devadatta, Sushruta, Visravas, Mangalya, Rishyasringa, Ekapada, Krouncha, Angiras, Pathanjali, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata, Maithreya, Pushpajith, Nidaga, Parasara, Vaisampayana, Yajnavalkya, Aswalayana, Anantakaruna, Amalakapriya and Kapila</span></b>.

Pipalatha and others gave us the Upanishads. All these great sages were attracted by the magnetic power of Arunachala of Tiruvannamalai.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Deiva Sigamani&nbsp;</span></b>Desika Paramacharya Swamigal - 700 years ago, hearing of his greatness, a King came to see him. Just then, his horse was bitten by a snake and the horse died. When the saint heard about the horse, he came out praying to Arunachala, tapped the horse’s body with his cane and brought it back to life. The King inscribed the story of the miracle performed by the saint on the south wall of the third prakara of the temple.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Mangaiyarkarasi</span></b>&nbsp;- She thus gave away all her wealth to Arunachaleswara and attained divine grace on her death. Her generous deeds are lauded in the inscriptions on the walls of the temple prakara.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Pani Pathraswami&nbsp;</span></b>- When he wished to take water to the temple, the water from the Brahma Thirtham came out of its own accord in his hands in the form of a vessel.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Dakshinamurthi Swami -</span></b>&nbsp;While performing many miracles in his life Dakshinamurti Swami, also spread the philosophy of Advaita.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Ammani Ammaiyar&nbsp;</span></b>- She had the gift of curing diseases by giving holy ash. Her samadhi is near the Eesanya linga. A temple has been built over it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify"><b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Angapradakshinam Annamalai Swami</span></b>&nbsp;- He was thus called because all his life he worshipped Arunachala by performing Angapradakshina that is rolling on the ground in an anticlockwise direction round the hill.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Irai Swamigal</span></b>&nbsp;- It is believed that there are 1008 lingas under each step round the hill, he would recite Arunachala’s name 100 times for each step he took while circumambulating the hill. After doing these for many hours, he would complete going round the hill and continue the chanting 1008 times the next day, from where he had left off.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Guhai Namasivayar</span></b>&nbsp;- Once, Namasivaya happened to bring a dead sheep back to life. Knowing this, some mischievous youths wanted to test him. They put a healthy man on a bamboo pad and had him pretend to be dead and took him to Guhai Namasivaya. Namasivaya, through his powers knew their trick, got annoyed and declared that the man was truly dead. The youths to their concern found that the man on the pad had indeed died. Two of the illustrious disciples of Guhai Namasivaya were Virupakshi Thevar and Guru Namasivayar. The former lived just above the cave of Guhai Namasivayar. At his death, his body naturally reduced to ashes. After about four centuries in the beginning of the 20th century, these ashes were made into the form of a linga by Bhagavan Ramana himself during his stay at Virupakshi cave.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Arunagirinathar</span></b>&nbsp;- Saint Arunagirinathar and Lord Muruga are inseparable. He lost his parents, when he was young and was brought up by his sister living at Tiruvannamalai. He lived a life of pleasure. When his sister scolded him for his conduct, he felt hurt and tried to kill himself by falling from the top of the Vallala Maharaja Gopuram in the temple. Lord Muruga stopped Him and blessed him with spiritual knowledge. Arunagiri spent sometime in Tiruvannamalai meditating on the divine.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Veera Vairagya Murthy Swam</span></b>i - During the Karthigai festival in Tiruvannamalai, he restored to life a cow slaughtered by a Muslim King. He also made the stone Nandi idol of bull to graze on grass. The Muslim King was amazed at his powers and praised the glory of Arunachaleswara.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Sonachala</span></b>&nbsp;- He went round the hill everyday without fail till he reached the Lord’s feet.&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">Sri Isanya Jnana Desikar Mutt&nbsp;</span></b>&amp; Samadhi Temple - It is said that tigers used to keep guard around this sage when he was absorbed in meditation. He attained Mahasamadhi in 1829. Two tigers sat close to him always. When devotees came to see him, he would ask the tigers to go into the nearby forest. Lord Arunachala used to manifest in the form of a Tiger to guard him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify"><b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">IDAIKADAR</span></b>&nbsp;- Sri IdaiKadar is one of the 18 renowned siddhars and considered an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Two of the biggest contributions of IdaiKadar is the invention of Kayakalpa techniques and the arrangement of Navagraha Nine Planets in temples. Kayakalpa is a legendary system of total body rejuvenation. Kayakalpa purifies, nurtures and revitalizes the constituent elements of the body, mind and psyche with a series of customized therapy sessions, herbo-mineral preparations, vital breathing practices, dietary guidelines and daily living recommendations. He is also known to have arranged the positions of the nine planets NavaGraha that are being followed in the temples of India. Earlier in the temples the NavaGrahas were placed circularly i.e. all the nine planets were facing each other and could interact directly. This means that a person going through a rough patch due to the malefic influence of one planet would continue to experience bad time as all the planets are in direct contact with each other and would be passing on their effect to the next one and so on. Realizing this, IdaiKadar arranged the planetary positions in such a way, so that no one planet would face the other planet directly. Idaikadar attained his maha nirvana or salvation in the Agni sthalam – Tiruvannamalai, and it is also believed that, the garbagriha or the main lingam of Tiruvannamalai is built on top of his Jeeva Samadhi. Some people claim that, his Jeeva Samadhi is behind the main lingam on the second orbit of the Lord Arunachaleswarar temple.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify"><b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI,</span></b>&nbsp;Thiruvannamalai - After having attained liberation at the age of 16, Sri Ramana Maharshi left home for Arunachala, a mountain considered sacred by the Hindus, at Tiruvannamalai and lived there for the rest of his life. Sri Ramana maintained that the purest form of his teachings was the powerful silence, which radiated from his presence and calmed the minds of those who were tuned to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify"><b><span style="font-family: .SFUIText-Bold;">SATHGURU SESHADIRI SWAMIGAL,&nbsp;</span></b>Thiruvannamalai, one of the greatest saints of all times. He has guided great Gurus like Ramana Maharishi, Vallimalai Sachidananda Swamigal and many others in their spiritual journey. He stayed in the crematoriums at Tiruvannamalai. He took food in the same leaf along with beggars and dogs and never bothered about rain or sunshine and lived with nature. The young child grew into a young sage of infinite realization, disappearing from a locked room where his family tried to keep him bound to family duties, manifesting yet again, his spiritual greatness. He journeyed to the sacred Tiruvannamalai and remained for 40 glorious years, until his Maha Samadhi. Guru and Master to hundreds of disciples, who made their way to him in pain and found solace in his presence. He performed innumerable miracles to help his committed disciples, remaining to this day a guiding light in their lives.</div>

The entire land area of Muniswarar is surrounded by Neem tree and other Holy trees.<br>
Udaiyalipatti MUNISWARAR TEMPLE Blessed for good health, marriage, child birth, construction of new houses and good education by praying Lord Muniswarar.<br>
SRI MUNISWARAR Koil Udaiyalipatti This is a village deity and is known as the protection deity of the village. No temple has been built, but only the virgin land with 400 years old tree is identified by the locals, as the temple area. Moreover, only one person known as “Pandaram” visits the land occasionally, to pray. All others including the villagers never ever visit the temple land area and never even walk around it for fear of the Lord's power which would punish the bad people instantly. It is a virgin land as no dishonest person has touched the land, even accidently. The forest trees that grow now in the temple land are mostly holy trees and most of the trees are the “favorite trees” of Lord Muniswarar. Holy trees grow on their own in this holy temple land. There is a banyan tree which is 400 years old and the main trunk of the tree has withered. However, there are still two branches which have life in it. Prayers are being conducted and there seems to be life in this tree. Even though the branches have fallen, nobody dares to touch the same and feel them since they are afraid of the Lord. The fallen branches are kept in the four corners of the land. No one has stolen the planks in fear. The huge base of the tree is still seen and is retained at the same place. To everybody's surprise there is a formation of Lord Ganesha at the base of the tree “like a panel”. A photograph of the Lord Ganesha's panel is printed in the ARRT booklet. There are 250 acres of land bought by Welcome Tours and Travels around the Lord Muniswarar Temple lands and developed for the use of Indian origin foreigners of Malaysia and Singapore under the guidance of Dr. Khadar Ibrahim, the great scholar who taught meaningful way to have interesting lifestyle with a proposal to build a huge Pyramid for the benefit of mankind. While the land was being excavated, a positive energy emerging after prayers to Lord Muniswarar were conducted. In fact, when work started on this land, the tractors did not start and also the computer system got shut off automatically. Then it was decided to pray to the Lord by offering flowers, and after which cleaning the land started and further poojas were conducted regularly with complete rituals. Lord Muniswarar allowed to do the work in and around the temple only after pleasing the Lord with prayers and offering of flowers. More than 100 trees and flowering plants were planted with the assistance of people from Malaysia and Singapore. This work of cultivating the land into a beautiful garden still continues. The energy of the Lord has been proven by the quick development that has taken place in the land than what was planned. It is believed that building a small ashram has motivated to build a huge Pyramid for all types of spiritual activities of Lord Muniswarar at this site.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">We are able to see several celebrities, actors, actress in cine field and others in better position, who has the kala sharpa effect i.e. Raghu Kethu yogam. So we can say Raghu kethu - Kala sharpa yogam will uplift you in future. Similarly Kala sharpa Dosha ie., Raghu Kethu Dosha will be unfavorable. In your previous birth if you have done some evil to the SHARPA KINGDOM - Kingdom of Snakes and for those who disturbed the life of Snakes in previous birth will get an effect of Kala Sharpa Dosham, such as Late Marriage, No improvement in Life, Failure is several life, Permanent Jobless situation, Divorce if married early, stress and depression may increase, gives the feeling of uncertainty. A Prayer and homam for Raghu Kethu at Thirupampuram temple can be conducted to achieve all the benefits of Raghu Kethu yogam and relief from Raghu Kethu Dosa.

One can achieve all the benefits by participating with pooja, prayer, Yaham conducted in Thirupampuram Temple and relieved from Raghu Kethu Dosa.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Thirupampuram Paampuranathar Temple is another significant Lord Shiva temple. The village in and around the temple have no history of snake bites and anyone, who visits the temple, is protected from snake bites. The king of serpents “Nagaraja” is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva here. The name Paampuranathar is associated with Nagaraja. It is said that often a snake is seen surrounding the God or Goddess. Frangrance of Jasmine and Thazhampu is prominent in and around the temple. The legend says people never die of snake bites here, though there are many snakes seen and spotted around in this place. This is because once Lord Vinayagar was offering prayers to Lord Shiva and at that time the serpent, which was around the neck of Lord Shiva, thought that he too was being worshipped by Lord Vinayagar. “Lord Shiva” was much annoyed, when he came to know of this proudness of the snake around his neck and threw a curse on the snake serpents snatching the power on shakthi of poison.</div>
<div class="text-justify">Aadhiseshan and other serpents came to earth on this occasion of Mahashivrateri and offered prayers to Kudanthai Nageshwarar in the Morning, Thirunageshwaram at Noon, Thirupamburam Pambureswarar in the Evening and Nagoor Nageswarar in the Night and got the blessings of the Lord. On 26-05-2002 a snake had dropped its skin on the Lord Shiva Lingam like a garland at this temple. This is still preserved at the temple and can be seen at the Lord’s sannidhi. Besides no history of snake bites in this place, the banyan tree which is the in front of the temple does not let its Aerial prop roots to fall on the ground. ‘Agathi Keerai(Greens)’ does not blossom flowers neither in and around the temple nor in the whole Village. In fact the legend runs that the serpents with King Nagaraja Aadhiseshan conducted Yaham to please Lord Shiva and for which they used Agathi Keerai(Greens) flowers, and Banyan tree aerial prop roots to garland Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva appeared and gave back poisonous powers to serpents with a condition that they should bless benefit that those visit the temple and should not bite any one in and around the village. Further serpents had asked back Lord Shiva a boon that the Banyan trees of the temple should not let its aerial prop roots to ground and Agathi Keerai(Greens) should not blossom flowers so that others who come to pray to the great Lord Shiva should not use the Aerial prop roots and Agathi Keerai flowers and this act of prayer should remain unique only to the serpents. This is a scientific miracle, the serpent request and Lord blessings become true. Till to date the Agathi Keerai (Greens) is not blossom flowers in the village around the temple and Banyan tree infront of the temple does not let its aerial roots to reach the ground.</div>

<div class="text-justify">The SANI DOSHA NIVARANA POOJA YAAHAM being performed at Thirunarayur temple is considered to be the most auspicious for eradication of the evil effects of Lord Sani. Undoubtedly, the devotees who have congregated for this holy event, or those who happen to hear the chanting of holy spell 'OM SANICHARAYA NAMHA' thereof happen to be or great virtue accumulated in their life. You can achieve all the benefits by visiting and performing SANISWARA YAHAM at THIRUNARAIYUR TEMPLE. In Thirunaraiyur temple, Lord Saniswaran living with two wives and two children. He is also called as mangala saniswaran and this is the only temple in the world, where Lord Saniswaran available with his family members. It is considered to be an important place of Saturn worship. It is said that in no other place, including the famous Thirunallar temple, he is worshipped along with his two wives, Mandhadevi and Jyeshtadevi and his two sons, Maandhi and Kuligan.</div>
<div class="text-justify">In the ancient texts, black oil and black grams have given prominence to please Sani Bhagavan. According to Puranas, the body of Lord Vishnu creates three types of grams ie., black, white and wheat colored grams. These three are said to be very holy ones. These grams are used in homas. It is difficult to please the Sani Bhagavan. The duty of Lord Sani is to punish the persons for the sins they have committed in previous jenma. To please Sani Bhagavan, one has to surrender themselves to Sani Bhagavan and offer prayers to please him. Offer prayers to Lord Shiva, Feeding poor people with food duly mixed with salt, Donating black dress to poor people on Saturday, Perform tailabhishekam to Lord Sani, Perform abishekam to Lord Shiva, Feed the black dogs, crows, black cow, Perform sindur puja to Lord Hanuman on Saturday.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">According to the legend when King Dasaratha ruled the entire world, Saturn was to pass through Rohini star after staying in Krithigai, on one occasion. Sage Vasishta and others told Dasaratha that if Saturn did so, it would spell doom for the world. There would be famine everywhere for 12 years and animals, human beings would be put to much hardship. He requested Dasaratha to prevent it. Dasaratha immediately got into his fast-moving chariot, carrying all Divine weapons and reached the star, Rohini. He saw Saturn moving in his golden chariot towards Rohini and sent the Divine weapons including the “Samhara Asthram” towards him. Saturn, laughing at the king’s futile attempts, told him that He could destroy anybody by His mere look. The powers that Dasaratha had got through severe penance, austerity and Divine grace prevented Saturn from eliminating him. Dasaratha requested Saturn not to pass through Rohini and thus spare the world from experiencing famine for 12 years. Saturn was immensely pleased with the king’s concern for the welfare of his subjects and granted two requests. He also told him that if he visited Thirunaraiyur and bathed in the tank there he would appear before him. Dasaratha agreed and Saturn appeared before him. As Thirunaraiyur is the place where he appeared before Dasaratha, it is considered to be an important place of Saturn worship. It is said that in no other place, including the more famous Thirunallar temple, is he worshipped along with his two wives, Mandhadevi and Jyeshtadevi and his two sons, Maandhi and Kuligan. According to the sthalapuranam, Lord Rama and Anjaneya, during their return from Lanka to Ayodhya, visited this place. Though a sub-shrine of the Ramanathaswami temple in Thirunaraiyur, which is also called as Saneeswarar Thirukkoil, Saturn’s abode here has separate Dhwajasthambam, Balipeetam and the crow mount in front of it. The sthalavriksham is “erukku” and the holy water source is known as Rama Theertham. The temple is agog with activity on Saturdays and during the Gurupeyarchi and Sanipeyarchi. The presiding deity in the main temple is Ramanathaswami, facing east, and it is considered to be as holy as in Rameswaram. Many devotees, who are unable to visit Rameswaram, make their offerings to the Lord here.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Conducted as Dharpanam pooja also known as Tithi for the blessings of our parents and ancestors at Srivanjiyum temple.People donate food to the hungry people in the hope that their ancestors will also be thus fed. People always realize the contributions of their forefathers, to their present life, and the cultural norms, traditions and values they set for us in order to make our lives better. According to the Vedic scriptures an individual is born with three debts. The debt to God is called ‘Dev-rin.’ The debt to the sages and saints is called ‘Rishi-rin.’ The third debt to one's parents and ancestors is called ‘Pitri-rin.’ These three debts are like three mortgages on one's life, but not liabilities. The third debt an individual is expected to pay during one's life is to one's parents and ancestors. Your ancestors are anxious to help you in all your endeavours and the departed souls are capable of doing so. However, they have one expectation from all and that is to perform acts of charity in their names and ancestors prayers known as tithi, shraadh or Shraadha or Dharpanam or anuual prayers and ceremonies during their annual visits to your homes in their subtle, invisible bodies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text-justify">Srivanjiyum - VAANCHINATHAR Temple Tiruvaanchiyam is sixteen times more sacred than Varanasi. Yama built the temple and also stayed on here, as the vehicle for the Lord siva. Yama, the God of Death has an exclusive shrine for himself and is given preference in the daily worship. The Lord siva also told Yama that here a temple would be built for him and that devotees, who visit the Lord, should first offer prayers to Yama. The Moorthy-Lingam is supposed to be thousand times greater than the Holy Kasi. Sirardhamand Thila Homam, Ceremonies, Tithi, Dharpanam can be performed here for a person to whom no ceremonies had been performed earlier or there was a break in performing the ceremony. The presiding deity of this sacred temple Vanchinathar is a Swayambu Lingam and the oldest, the most ancient of the 64 Swayambhu Siva Lingams in the world. A prominent feature of this temple is that Yama, the God of Death has an exclusive shrine for himself and is given preference in the daily worship. A separate shrine for Bhairavar in a yogic posture is another rare feature of this temple. The unique feature of this temple is the shrine for both Rahu-Kethu which is carved out in one composite sculpture and when milk is poured over this Rahu-Kethu sculpture, it turns blue in colour. Worshiping at this shrine is said to bless devotees with marriage and progeny and cure nerve disorders. Worshiping Mahishasuramardhini with 108 lotus flowers during Rahu kalam is considered auspicious. A holy dip in Lakshmi Theertham is said to reunite a person with his separated family. A holy dip in Naga Theertham is said to liberate one, of all Naga Doshas. A holy dip in Chakra Theertham absolves one of Brahmahatti Dosham. Devotees are also cured of illness after a bath in the Gupta Ganga. According to the Puranas, a holy dip in the Gupta Ganga is equal to the ones in Varanasi, Rameswaram and the Maha Maham Tank at Kumbakonam. Lord Vinayakar on the banks of the Gupta Ganga is to be worshipped first, before taking the holy dip. According to legend, Yama, the God of Death, was worried about him and the consequences of taking away so many lives and wanted to atone for this act. Brahma allayed Yama’s fears and asked him to meditate on Lord Shiva for answer. Yama went to Gandhaaranyam, the fragrant forest and perform his penance. Sure enough, Lord Shiva appeared before Yama and asked him to built a temple. Yama built the temple and also stayed on here, as the vehicle for the Lord. The Lord also told Yama that a temple would be built for him and that devotees, who visit the Lord, should first offer prayers to Yama. A dip in the Gupta Ganga Tank is supposed to be a blessing and absolve one, of all sins and rebirths. The Moorthy-Lingam is supposed to be thousand times greater than the Holy Kasi. Here, even a death does not impact the routine Poojas, conducted in the temple. Normally, if there is a death in the village, the temple remains closed until the last rites are completed and not the case in this holy place of SRIVANJIYUM.</div>

<div  class="text-justify">PRATYANGIRA DEVI Temple Kumbakonam - The Pratyangira aspect of the Divine has been a bit of a secret for most of bygone ages. Many believed that direct experience with this energy was reserved for Saints and Rishis. Seeing Pratyangira in any form was considered an enormous blessing. Prayer and Pooja are performed mainly to protect oneself from black magic and to prosper in life. Advantages of this prayer and sadhana are many including tremendous Vak siddhi, Karya siddhi, healthy body, full protection from accidents and sudden deaths and people, who are dumb are also benefitted. She punishes the enemies of her devotees. The temple was built amidst eight cemeteries, burning ghats and no archanai or abishekam is performed in this temple. Only homam is done on “no moon nights” and the main ingredient for the homam is dried chillies thrown in tonnes, in the homan fire, but it is surprising to note, that the chillies do not harm anyone participating in the homan, while it is burning in the fire. Normally the red chillies smoke while burnt in fire harm humanss and cause nonstop cough. But this does not happen while tons of chillies are thrown into Homam fire at this temple. Performing yagams, homams and prayers to the Goddess, protects true devotees from enemies and even punishes enemies and wins over their evil plotting. If you are a true devotee she is the most wonderful mother.</div>

Finally, prostrate or do a namaskaram near the Dhwajasthambam. Nine pradarshanams of the outer praharam is recommended. The temple priests do uchi kala pooja at 12 o’noon on Sundays and offer hot curd rice nivethiyam to lord. After the prayer the hot curd rice is given to devotees in a “vella errukku leaf” - holy plant. It is belived that those eat the prasatham of hot curd rice from the “vella errukku leaf” for 11 continued Sundays will get cured all type of skin diseases.</div>

It used to be painful and no applications of any cream gave relief. The previous day too, I had experienced it in the hotel room in Kumbhakonam. As I took the abhishekam’s milk in my palm, I spoke to the Lord silently, “if you could really cure my pain I would be grateful.” That night, I did not wake up in pain. I woke up at 5 a.m. only when the hotel’s wake up call was made. And to this day, I have not experienced any pain. A month later, my sister telephoned me and I was shocked to know that she had cancer. I turned to Dr. Vaidyanatha Swamy and arranged for an abhishekam and a special puja in her name and the priest sent her the prasadams by courier. Later we came to know that she had been cured. So, was a cousin of mine, who is in the US and was diagnosed with brain tumor. Though it was removed surgically, he was warned that it could recur any time. It was a serious case. After similar pujas he is now progressing very well and even drives his car. A little girl, our friend’s niece, was admitted to the hospital with a sudden rise in body temperature and was in the ICU with all the organs failing, gradually. An abhishekham to the lord .... and improvement started the very next day and she became fine.</div>

The five elements are as follows - EARTH, WATER, AIR, FIRE, and SPACE. There is an invisible and constant relation among all the five elements. It is believed that a person can improve his status by designing his buildings in conjunction with the effectiveness of these five natural forces. Vastu Shastra combines all the five elements of nature and balances them with the person and the material. It takes advantage of the benefits bestowed by the five elements of nature to create a congenial living and working environment thereby facilitating spiritual well-being and paving the way for enhanced health, prosperity and happiness.</div>
