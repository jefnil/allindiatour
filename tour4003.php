				<p><strong>AGRICULTURE AND FARMING:</strong></p>
				 
				<p>Agriculture is the cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber and biofuel, medicinal and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species creates surplus food that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of irrigation, although there are methods of farming. Livestock are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world's ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture, including permaculture and organic agriculture.Farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history. The transition from hunter-gatherer to settled,agricultural societies is called the Neolithic Revolution and first began around 12,000 years ago. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. Subsequent step-changes in human farming practices were provoked by the British Agricultural Revolution in the eighteenth century, and the Green Revolution of the second half of the twentieth.
				 </p>
				 
				<p><strong>CATTLE FARMING:</strong></p>
				 
				<p>It is the act of raising and breeding cattle for the production of milk. Besides being nutritious and delicious and a nutrient dense food, cattle provide over 900 by products that are used by EVERYONE. They contribute to the roads we drive on, medicinal and pharmaceuticals, leather and other products, shampoos and soaps and lotions, even the tires on our cars. There is so much we get from cows; Cattle also act as fire retardants in brushy area and can reduce the increasingly dangerous "fire load" that we all see in the West. If we don't let fires burn (naturally), then we should allow cows to graze, on marginal lands where the brush and undergrowth thrives. As a result, there is nothing for grazing for deer and other wildlife and the brush SUCKS up water faster than people can imagine. If water, fire, and open land is of importance to people, then they should learn to appreciate and understand the incredible contributions cattle -- who co-exist with wildlife and waterfowl and rivers,streams, etc. -- without harming them! The misinformation abounds about cattle, which is terribly sad because they can contribute so much environmentally to our lives.

				<p><strong>INDIA HAS EVERYTHING - TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY </strong></p>
				 
				<p>Our land has a very rich heritage. We have many Rishisand Siddhas. Each temple has an interesting story and history. Miracles happen all the time, only, we fail to see them. We fail even to believe them some time. Faith can move mountains. Faith can cure too. Nature has endowed the earth with a variety of herbs and shrubs that cure ailments. Sidha offers a whole range of natural medicines. When illnesses defy all treatment, it is common in India, for people, to appeal to the Gods and promise to offer physical sevas, like Angapradakshanams and Thulabharams, the system of weighing oneself against butter, bananas, sesame seeds, etc., if cured. From the time of the oracle of Delphi to St. Joan’s hearing of “Voices”, prediction of future events have considerably influenced the course of history. To a spiritualist, the ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ may appear as one continuous stream of time and a prediction may be, more of an accurate photographic recording of occurrences. Predictions are also sometimes made in trance-like state. Whatever may be their genesis, predictions are considered as “forewarnings”. Ironically, very often, predictions are considered true only when people fail to take timely action to thwart a predicted danger. Indian epics are full of predictions, both heeded and unheeded. The Holy land of India has witnessed the incarnation of countless saints. Srimad Bhagavatam declared that the Lord would incarnate in this land in this Age of Kali, in the form of saints. True to the text, saints have blessed this land with the touch of their feet, Each of them lived to prove the greatness of singing the Divine Names of the Lord.
