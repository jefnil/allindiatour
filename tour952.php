<p>GOMATHA POOJA :</p>
<p>(3) Komatha … Gomatha ….Pooja @ Thiruvannamalai – La Woods Hotel Site…..plays the role of a mother giving enlightment of truth, wisdom and prosperity. One who adores and conducts pooja is granted all desires and has the blessings of the three main Goddesses Lakshmi, Durga and Saraswathy.<br>
The importance and divinity of komatha and nandhini can be heard from the story of sage, ‘Viswamitra’.</p>
<p>Vishwamitra was a king and was known as Kaushika, the descendent of kusha dynasty. Once, Vishwamitra and his soldiers took shelter in the Ashram of Rishi Vasishta. Vasishta took care of his large army and fed his soldiers well. Vishwamitra was surprised as to how it was possible for a sage to take care and make all arrangements to feed such a large army. Vishwamitra was inquisite to understand the mystery from Vasishta. Vasishta replied that he had a divine calf Nandini, gifted by Indra. Nandini was the daughter of Indra`s cow Kamdhenu. Vishwamitra was overwhelmed to know the truth. He decided to possess that cow as he thought that a humble sage like Vasishta did not require this cow. Vishwamitra expressed his desire to sage Vasishta. Vasishta refused the proposal in a polite manner. The king was extremely angry. Vishwamitra ordered his army to seize the cow and drive it to his kingdom. Vasishta to encounter them created an army of fierce warrior with his yogic power. They fought the army of Vishwamitra and defeated them. Vishwamitra was imprisoned in the war and presented before Vasishta but the BrahmarishiVasishta forgive him and released him with words of advice. This incident made a deep impression on King Vishwamitra. He realized that power gained by penance is much greater than the physical power of a king. He vowed to be a greater Rishi than Sage Vasishta and renounced his kingdom. By penance he took the name Vishwamitra. After severe austerity and many sacrifice Vishwamitra won the title of Brahmarishi by Vashita himself.<br>

<p>If a cow eats something poisonous by mistake, and we drink its milk, will we fall ill ??? To test this, the cow was regularly fed with a particular quantity of a poison every day. After 24 hours, its blood, urine, dung and milk were tested in a lab to check if the poison could be found. These tests were done continuously for 90 days in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi. The researcher did not find any trace of poison in milk, blood, urine or dung of that cow. Where did the poison fed to the cow for 90 days disappear ??? Just like Lord Shiva held poison in his throat, the gomatha hid the entire poison in her throat. No other animal has this special quality. Cow is the only creature that inhales oxygen and also exhales oxygen. Cow milk has the quality of countering poison. Urine of Go-matha has the power to cure a few diseases though medical science is yet to understand. If cow-ghee and rice are cooked together, two powerful gases called ethylene-oxide, propylene-oxide are released. Propylene-oxide is the best gas used for creating artificial rain. Cow-urine is the world’s best killer of microbes -Bacteria and Germs. Medicines made by using cow dung and cow urine, stomach-related ailments can be cured. The medical sciences says that cow-dung plastering home save from radio-waves. Cow-dung has the power to destroy the microbes – Bacteria causing cholera.If 10 grams of cow-ghee is put in fire (Yaham), 1000 kilograms of oxygen is generated. Cow-urine is as sacred as Ganga-jal</p>
<p>HOMAM YAHAM : – Cost included in the package<br>
(1) Homam… Pooja…. Prayer…. and Yaham… Benefits and its Feature</p>
<p>Five elements !!!!!<br>
Five elements temple !!!</p>
<p>Homams and Poojas are performed for a particular deity by invoking Agni, the God of fire. The Sun is considered as the main source of energy, and fire is considered as a representation of the Sun’s energy. According to the ancient texts on Homams, anything offered in a Fire towards God, is actually an offer to Sun. Any such offer is done either to enrich energy or to destroy the undesirable elements in the environment, and thus, in both ways, environment is protected. Poojas, Homams are also believed to be one of the greatest rituals in Hindu religion, whereby performing this, one can get rid of any obstacles and also attain self-satisfaction. The idea of all Homams is the prosperity of the people by energizing and protecting the environment. It is told that when Lord Brahma (the creator among the Trinity) created a human, he also created Homam for human’s livelihood and their attainment of desires. The main aim of Homam is derived from the Vedas or from the ancient texts of Hindus. These Vedas explain as to how a human should be, how they should be helpful to others and the good actions that they should perform. Vedas and Homam are eternal truth which have neither a beginning nor end, and are divine, not the creation of humans.</p>
<p>To perform any Pooja or Homam, a Priest is appointed. While performing any Pooja, the Priest or Panditji perform the Pooja of the Lord Ganesh as Lord Ganesh holds a unique position in the Indian culture. For any ceremony or ritual, a Pooja is performed before beginning a new venture by invoking the power of Ganesh. A Kalash (brass or copper pot filled with sacred water) is placed with a coconut and different fruits, grains and betel leaves in the front. After the Ganesh Pooja is completed, the Pooja of the respective God or Goddess and Yantra is performed on whose behalf the Homam is performed. This is done with the recitation of a Mantra for that particular deity with the offerings of water, Chandan (sandalwood) paste, Sindoor (vermilion), rice, milk mixed with floral-scented oil, flowers, fruits and sweets. After the Pooja is completed by the Priest, preparations are made for the Yagna or Homams (sacred fire ritual) to be performed. This is the last part of the Pooja and is performed for more than an hour.</p>
<p>A few things that are placed in the Agni (sacred fire) during Homam are said to transmit a kind of medicinal smoke and this smoke mixes in the air thereby curing few of the human diseases. Sandalwood, small pieces of Banyan tree, fragrant, 108 types of herbs and pure ghee are used as an offering to the Agni (sacred fire), with the recitation of Mantras. The smoke, which is emitted out of the Homams, purify the air and this smoke does not cause any air pollution and has a feel of some medicinal values. In the end, the Yantras are energized with the vibrations of the Mantras. The energized Yantras are thus empowered and enable the purpose for which they are being used.</p>

<p>VILLAGE:</p>
<p>A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.<br>
In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practise subsistence agriculture, and also for some non-agricultural societies. In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. Villages have been eclipsed in importance as units of human society and settlement.<br>
Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village was small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families. Homes were situated together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.</p>
<p>INDIA HAS EVERYTHING – TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY</p>
<p>Our land has a very rich heritage. We have many Rishisand Siddhas. Each temple has an interesting story and history. Miracles happen all the time, only, we fail to see them. We fail even to believe them some time. Faith can move mountains. Faith can cure too. Nature has endowed the earth with a variety of herbs and shrubs that cure ailments. Ayurveda offers a whole range of natural medicines. When illnesses defy all treatment, it is common in India, for people, to appeal to the Gods and promise to offer physical sevas, like Angapradakshanams and Thulabharams, the system of weighing oneself against butter, bananas, sesame seeds, etc., if cured. From the time of the oracle of Delphi to St. Joan’s hearing of “Voices”, prediction of future events have considerably influenced the course of history. To a spiritualist, the ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ may appear as one continuous stream of time and a prediction may be, more of an accurate photographic recording of occurrences. Predictions are also sometimes made in trance-like state. Whatever may be their genesis, predictions are considered as “forewarnings”. Ironically, very often, predictions are considered true only when people fail to take timely action to thwart a predicted danger. Indian epics are full of predictions, both heeded and unheeded. The Holy land of India has witnessed the incarnation of countless saints. SrimadBhagavatam declared that the Lord would incarnate in this land in this Age of Kali, in the form of saints. True to the text, saints have blessed this land with the touch of their feet, Each of them lived to prove the greatness of singing the Divine Names of the Lord.</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE AND FARMING:</p>
<p>Agriculture is the cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber and biofuel, medicinal and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species creates surplus food that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of irrigation, although there are methods of farming. Livestock are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world’s ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, industrial agriculturebased on large-scale monoculture has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture, including permaculture and organic agriculture.</p>
<p>Farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history. The transition from hunter-gatherer to settled,agricultural societies is called the Neolithic Revolution and first began around 12,000 years ago. It was the world’s first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. Subsequent step-changes in human farming practices were provoked by the British Agricultural Revolution in the eighteenth century, and the Green Revolution of the second half of the twentieth.</p>
<p>CATTLE FARMING:</p>
<p>It is the act of raising and breeding cattle for the production of milk. Besides being nutritious and delicious and a nutrient dense food, cattle provide over 900 by products that are used by EVERYONE. They contribute to the roads we drive on, medicinal and pharmaceuticals, leather and other products, shampoos and soaps and lotions, even the tires on our cars. There is so much we get from cows; Cattle also act as fire retardants in brushy area and can reduce the increasingly dangerous “fire load” that we all see in the West. If we don’t let fires burn (naturally), then we should allow cows to graze, on marginal lands where the brush and undergrowth thrives. As a result, there is nothing for grazing for deer and other wildlife and the brush SUCKS up water faster than people can imagine. If water, fire, and open land is of importance to people, then they should learn to appreciate and understand the incredible contributions cattle — who co-exist with wildlife and waterfowl and rivers,streams, etc. — without harming them! The misinformation abounds about cattle, which is terribly sad because they can contribute so much environmentally to our lives.</p>

<p>THIRUVANNAMALAI HILL AND ITS GREATNESS…</p>
<p>One will surely attain liberation … By seeing Chidambaram, by being born, in Tiruvarur, by dying in Kasi, or by merely thinking of Arunachala, the lord hills at Thiruvannamalai<br>
The supreme knowledge (Self-knowledge), the import of Vedanta, which cannot be attained without great difficulty, can easily be attained by anyone who sees the form of this hill from wherever it is visible or who even thinks of it by mind from far.<br>
I have seen a wonder, a magnetic hill that forcibly attracts the soul. Arresting the activities of the soul who thinks of it even once, drawing it to face itself, the One, making it thus motionless like itself, it feeds upon that sweet soul. What a wonder is this! O souls, be saved by thinking of this great Arunagiri, which shines in the mind as the destroyer of the soul.</p>
<p>THIRUVANNAMALAI TEMPLE:</p>
<p>SIDHARGALS &amp; History Of Tiruvannamalai – Successive Kings of South India have given great importance to Tiruvannamalai and the temple of Arunachala. For a thousand years, these kings have built prakaras outlying temples, gopurams and compound walls, dug ponds, offered jewels and donated gold for the upkeep of temple lands. The atmosphere of the temple and the vibration one feels inside it, are indescribable. The variegated architectural styles of generations of kings who built and renovated its massive gopurams and halls, the living presence of the great saints who stayed here and sang the Lord’s praise and above all, the infinite compassion and grace of Arunachala, give this holiest of holy places, a timeless quality. KarthigaiDeepamFestival At Tiruvannamalai – Brahma and Vishnu were both quarrelling about their relative superiority. To give a decision on it and to erase their ego Lord Shiva stood before them in the form of a blazing mountain. Having failed in their attempt to find out its top and bottom the two prayed to Lord Shiva for His grace. He blessed them saying that he would appear in the form of Jothi on the top of the hill every year on the day of Karthigai in the month of Karthigai. To commemorate this event the Deepamfestival is being conducted at Tiruvannamalai every year. There is ample literary evidence to prove that this lighting festival is one of the oldest in Tamil culture. Tholkappiamis one of the oldest available works in Tamil literature andwhile commenting on one of the Sutras in Tholkappiam, Nachinarkiniar, the prince of commentators, mentions “the light lit on the Karthigai day of the Karthigai month”. Scholars ascribe the age of Tholkappiam to be three thousand years old. JeevakaChintamani, a Jain work and one of the five great Tamil Epics by ThirthakkaDevar, mentions “lighting a lamp on the hill on Karthigai day”. Karnarpathu and Kalavazhinarpathu, the two old Tamil literary works refer to lighting on the Karthigai day. Saints Appar and Sambandar who hailed in the 7th century A.D. make references about it There is a proverbial saying, “light on the hill” when one wants to express a thing world-wide known. Girivalam- the Holy Mountain of Arunachala rises up to an elevation of 2669 feet. The road encircling the mountain where devotees circumambulate is 14 kms long. On Full Moon days and festival days like Karthigai, the first day of the Tamil month and Tamil New Year day hundreds of thousands of devotees undertake girivalam i.e. circumambulating the mountain to get the blessings of the Lord Arunachala. This hill is made up of igneous rock connected with fire which is one of the four kinds of mountains classified by geology. So, one sees the truth behind the tradition regarding the origin and formation of this hill. Our religious philosophy is based on science and there is always the combination of VignanaandMeygnana. These two are inextricably intertwined. An American Geologist has stated about this mountain thus: – “Arunachala should have been thrown up by the earth under the stress of some violent volcanic eruption in the Dim Ages before even the coal-bearing layers were formed. It existed long before the gigantic saurians of the pre-historic world, moved their ungainly forms through the prehistoric forests that covered our early earth. Arunachalaisalmost as hoary and as ancient as our planetary home itself. What a miracle! Such a barren rock has captivated the souls of sages and saints for ages together. Legends say that Tiruvannamalai was a fire alias Agni Mountain in Krathayuga, Gold alias Swarna Mountain in Thrathayugha, Copper alias Thambra Mountain in Duvaparayuga and Rock Mountain in this Kaliyuga. Arunachala hill has a religious status in our sacred tradition. Tamil legends hold that it is far more ancient than the Himalayas, which are comparatively known to be of later origin. Arunachala is a combination of two Sanskrit words Aruna and Achala. Aruna means ‘red’ and Achala means ‘ immovable mount’, thereby known as the “Red Mount”. There are eight Lingas, eight Nandis, more than 350 tanks and many mandapams around the hill. The eight Lingams are IndiraLingams. In the East is the first lingam in the girivalam. Agni Lingam in the South East is the second. Ema Lingam in the South is the third. Niruthi Lingam in the South West is the fourth. Sanithirtham is nearer to this Lingam. Varuna Lingam in the West is in the Western direction and the Varunathirtham is situated next to this. Vaayu Lingam in the Northwest is the sixth in the row. Kubera Lingam in the North is the important Lingam in the Girivalam. People throw coins on this Lingam. Esanya Lingam in the North East is the Last Lingam in the girivalam. Caves In The Heart OfArunachala, Tiruvannamalai – There are many caves in Arunachala. There are caves formed by two or three rocks which can accommodate only a single person and there are huge caves made of massive rocks where many people can live comfortably. Even a small cave can protect one from rain, cold and heat. Some have a small opening, enough only for a person to crawl through, but inside they are large. There are also mysterious caves which are beyond exploration. There are vast spaces inside the holy hill which contain delectable sights. There are pathways, gardens and waterfalls. The Puranas say so and even yogis have confirmed, that from these mysterious caves, one can watch the wonderful sights and also see siddhas deep in samadhi, oblivious to the world, content with partaking and absorbing the abundant grace of Arunachala. SiddharsAnd Saints OfTiruvannamalai- Many ancient sages from the Himalayas and other sacred places of India came to Arunachala, either on a pilgrimage or to live in its vicinity. Some of these rishis were Pulastya, Vasishta, Marichi, Agastya, Dadichi, Nagana, Brigu, Atri, Jabali, Jaimini, Jamadagni, Bharata, Pipalata, Kasyapa, Kumudha, Varsha, Vibandaga, Vyasa, Mandavya, Matanga, Kukshi, Mandakarni, Chandilya, Maduchandas, Gargeya, Apasthamba, Romesamuni, Bhargava, Bharadwaja, Swetaketu, Koundinya, Pundarika, Valmiki, Narada, Vahini, Bodayana, Mrukandu, Durvasa, Gangavarya, Devadatta, Sushruta, Visravas, Mangalya, Rishyasringa, Ekapada, Krouncha, Angiras, Pathanjali, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata, Maithreya, Pushpajith, Nidaga, Parasara, Vaisampayana, Yajnavalkya, Aswalayana, Anantakaruna, Amalakapriya and Kapila. Of these Valmiki and and a few others gave us the itihasas; Vyasa, Narada and some others gave us the Puranas; Apastamba, Bodayana, Yajnavalkya, Parasara, Jaimini and others gave us portions of the Vedas. Pipalatha and others gave us the Upanishads. All these great sages were attracted by the magnetic power of Arunachala of Tiruvannamalai. DeivaSigamaniDesikaParamacharyaSwamigal – Some 700 years ago, DeivaSigamaniDesikaParamacharya lived in a cottage on the eastern side of Arunachala. He worshipped Arunachala and spread Saivism through his followers. Hearing of his greatness, a King came to see him. Just then, his horse was bitten by a snake and the horse died. The King was upset, but his minister persuaded him to meet the sage. When the saint heard about the horse, he came out praying to Arunachala, tapped the horse’s body with his cane and brought it back to life. The saint asked the King to undertake the renovation of the Arunachaleswara temple. The King inscribed the story of the miracle performed by the saint on the south wall of the third prakara of the temple. Mangaiyarkarasi – This celebrated saint had a deep love for Arunachala and his devotees. Once when the people of Tiruvannamalaisuffered from water scarcity, the saint constructed a large tank here. She also constructed a mandapam in the third prakara of the temple so that Arunachaleswara Himself could watch the Holy fire being lit on top of the hill. This is known as the DeepaDarshanamandapam. She also made offerings of jewels to the Lord. She thus gave away all her wealth to Arunachaleswara and attained divine grace on her death. Her generous deeds are lauded in the inscriptions on the walls of the temple prakara. PaniPathraswami – The real name of PaniPathraswami was Giri Deva. When he wished to take water to the temple, the water from the Brahma Thirtham came out of its own accord in his hands in the form of a vessel. Hence he came to be known as Panialias Water Pathra alias Vessel Swami. It is said Arunachaleswara gave him a gold coin everyday to help him feed His devotees. DakshinamurthiSwami – He did not speak until he was five. An ascetic told his parents, “Talk to him, he will speak now”. The boy’s parents asked him why he did not speak until then, to which he spoke words of deep spiritual significance, “I remained quiet — i.e., I had no mental activity”. The holy man then asked him “Who are you”? The boy replied “You are me, I am you”. The holy man praised the boy for his high spiritual state in which he was in unison, with all creation. AmmaniAmmaiyar – She had the gift of curing diseases by giving holy ash. In order to raise funds for the renovation of the Northern side of the gopuram, she travelled widely and collected money from rich people and completed the renovation work. Her samadhi is near the Eesanyalinga. A temple has been built over it. AngapradakshinamAnnamalai Swami – He was thus called because all his life he worshipped Arunachalaby performing Angapradakshina that is rolling on the ground in an anticlockwise direction round the hill.<br>
IraiSwamigal – It is believed that there are 1008 lingasunder each step round the hill, he would recite Arunachala’s name 100 times for each step he took while circumambulating the hill. After doing these for many hours, he would complete going round the hill and continue the chanting 1008 times the next day, from where he had left off. Many devotees gathered around him to watch this. GuhaiNamasivayar – A fifteenth century saint from Karnataka came to Tiruvannamalai but refused to enter the temple or bow down to Lord Arunachala out of loyalty to his Guru. Once, Namasivaya happened to bring a dead sheep back to life. Knowing of this, some mischievous youths wanted to test him. They put a healthy man on a bamboo pad and had him pretend to be dead and took him to GuhaiNamasivaya. They prayed to him to bring the man back to life. Namasivaya, through his powers knew their trick, got annoyed and declared that the man was truly dead. The youths to their concern found that the man on the pad had indeed died. GuhaiNamasivayawas so annoyed that he composed a venba in Tamil which says, “This Tiruvannamalai is a place for wicked men, where killings go on without being questioned and only scoundrels survive”. He wanted to end the venba thus, “it is to be destroyed by my curse”. But suddenly Arunachalacaught him around the neck, saying “Oh, how can you say that when I am here”. Hearing this GuhaiNamasivayachanged the last line to, “The place that can never be destroyed is Tiruvannamalai”. Two of the illustrious disciples of GuhaiNamasivaya were VirupakshiThevar and Guru Namasivayar. The former lived just above the cave of GuhaiNamasivayar. At his death, his body naturally reduced to ashes. After about four centuries in the beginning of the 20th century these ashes were made into the form of a linga by BhagavanRamana himself during his stay at Virupakshi cave. Arunagirinathar – Saint Arunagirinathar and Lord Muruga are inseparable, like Saivism and Tamil. He lost his parents when he was young and was brought up by his sister living at Tiruvannamalai. He lived a life of pleasure. When his sister scolded him for his conduct, he felt hurt and tried to kill himself by falling from the top of the Vallala Maharaja Gopuram in the temple. Lord Muruga stopped Him and blessed him with spiritual knowledge. Arunagiri spent sometime in Tiruvannamalai meditating on the divine. VeeraVairagya Murthy Swami – VeeraVairagyaMurthy Swami established a mutt in a village called Seenandal, near Parvata hill north of Tiruvannamalai. During the Karthigai festival in Tiruvannamalai, he restored to life a cow slaughtered by a Muslim King. He also made the stone Nandi idol of bull to graze on grass. The Muslim King was amazed at his powers and praised the glory of Arunachaleswara. SonachalaThevar relinquished the position of Thirupporur Mata Adinam in order to live close to Arunachala. He went round the hill everyday without fail till he reached the Lord’s feet. Ramana And Seshadri – In 1896 BhagavanRamanacame to Tiruvannamalai and immersed in deep samadhiinside the Pathalalinga in the temple. Some rogues troubled Ramana by throwing stones at him. Seshadrishooed away the boys and sent some devotees to bring him out of the cellar. He sent spiritual seekers to Ramana. Sometimes he would refer to Ramana as a murderer, meaning he helped to destroy the ego. When Ramana was in Virupakshi cave, Seshadri told a disciple, “My salary is only a thousand rupees. There is someone there who earns ten thousand rupees. Should you not try and retrieve at least ten rupees from Him?” He was of course speaking in spiritual terms. Once Seshadri Swami said to Ramana, if one thinks of Arunachala one will get liberation’. Ramanacountered with ‘Who thinks? Who gets liberation?’ SeshadriSwamy laughed heartily and said, ‘That is what I don’t know’. Once, SeshadriSwamy sat for sometime before Ramana and then left saying, ‘I don’t know what this thinks’. A devotee told Ramana that everyone called Seshadri a mad man. Ramana smilingly replied that there were three mad men in Arunachala. One was Seshadri, the second was Arunachaleswara and the third was himself. Seshadri performed many miracles to relieve the sufferings of his devotees. As Thiruvenkadar says, “They wander like ghosts, lie about like cadavers and eat like dogs when the food is thrown to them. They go round like the river, think of women as their mother, teach humility to all and are like children. They know the truth”. This is an apt description of SeshadriSwamy. He attained the Lord’s feet in 1929, BhagavanRamana was present when the samadhi was constructed and Seshadri Swami’s holy body was interred. Sri IsanyaJnanaDesikar Mutt &amp; Samadhi Temple – It is said that tigers used to keep guard around this sage when he was absorbed in meditation. He attained Mahasamadhi in 1829. Two tigers sat close to him always. When devotees came to see him, he would ask the tigers to go into the nearby forest. A temple has been built over his samadhi and ritual worship is still being performed there. When no devotees were near him, IsanyaDesikar, who was then about sixty years of age, liked to sit naked, absorbed in samadhi. On such occasions Lord Arunachaleswara himself sometimes used to manifest in the form of a tiger to guard him and prevent anyone from disturbing him. IsanyaDesikar knew what was happening. Each time he came out of samadhi, he would fondly run his fingers through the hair of the tiger and address him lovingly as ‘Arunachala, my Lord’. Occasionally other tigers from the forest would come along and help Arunachaleswara with his guard duties. IsanyaDesikar knew that the presence of the tigers would threaten other people, so whenever he saw that devotees were about to visit him, he would send the tigers away by saying, ‘My devotees may get frightened if they see you. Please keep away.’</p>
