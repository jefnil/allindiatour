                HYDERABAD It is the state capital of Andhra Pradesh teeming with bazaars of the old city, where stands the 400 year old Charminar, which is as much the signature of Hyderabad, as the Taj Mahal is for Agra or the Eiffel Tower for Paris. The modern shopping complexes and ultra modern malls in the newer areas of the city add further charm to Hyderabad. Cyberabad is a new local area created to keep pace with the booming Information Technology sector. Pearls, bangles, silks, computer software, handicrafts and above all a delectable cuisine, add to the splendour of this great city. Golconda Fort, capital of the erstwhile Kingdom by that name, is today very much part of the city. The fort is famous for its acoustics, palaces, ingenious water supply system and the famous Fateh Rahben Gun, one of the cannons used in the last siege of Golconda by Aurangzeb, to whom the fort ultimately fell. Qutub Shahi Tombs - It's the only one of its kind in the world, where an entire dynasty has been buried at one place.  Mecca Masjid - The bricks were brought from Mecca to build the central arch here. Salar Jung Museum - This museum houses one of the largest one-man collections of antiques of the world by Mir Yousuf Ali Khan, Salar Jung III. The objects available at the Museum include Persian carpets, Mughal miniatures, Chinese porcelain, Japanese lacquer ware, famous statues  including the veiled Rebecca, Marguerite and Mephistopheles, a superb collection of jade, daggers belonging to Queen Noor Jahan the Emperors Jahangir and Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb's sword and many other fabulous items. Birla Mandir - This white marble temple of Lord Venkateshwara floats on the city skyline, on Kala Pahad. Hussain Sagar Lake - The lake has a promenade that is a busy thoroughfare today. Boating and water sports are a regular feature in the Hussain Sagar. One of the world's tallest monolithic statues of the Buddha stands on the 'Rock of Gibraltar' in the middle of the lake. Ramoji Film City - This is a dream world created, for the celluloid on a sprawling 1500 acres, with every imaginable type of set.  Ramoji Film City on the outskirts of Hyderabad offers facilities to produce any kind of movie.  Shopping - Laad Bazaar is the famous, colourful shopping centre of the old city. It is tucked away in one of the streets leading off from the Charminar, selling bridal wear, pearls and the traditional Hyderabadi glass and stone studded bangles. Hyderabadi Cuisine -Nurtured by the Moghul magnificence in the heart of South India, the cuisine combines the very best of Moghlai food, such as Haleem and Mutton Biriyani, with the hauntingly aromatic, spicy, tart and pungent seasonings of the South. The kitchens of the Nawabs, Rajahs and Jagirdars combined the Moghul influence with the predominantly Hindu sub-culture to cook up a cuisine that is the ultimate in fine dining. Sweets like Double Ka Meetha and Qurbani Ka Meetha are distinctly Hyderabadi.

The picturesque surroundings presented by the banks of the river Sauparnika, the lush green Kodachadri hill and  the temple attracts millions of pilgrims every year.

People have high faith in Mookambika Devi Temple as Goddess Mookambika is regarded as a manifestation of Shakti, Saraswathi and Mahalakshmi. Former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Sri M.G.R gifted a gold sword.  The former Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sri Gundu Rao, also donated a similar type of sword, made of silver.

On one occasion, about six decades ago, a fierce yellow serpent was known to have carried an evil snake in its mouth, which was released later. But the evil serpent raised its hood. The fierce snake swallowed that cobra again. The late Valia Amma came to the spot with tears in her eyes and spoke a few words. The serpent did not budge. Amma became sad. With the chanting of manthras, she prayed for the release of the cobra. Without delay, the serpent left the cobra, bent down its head and went straight into the Appooppan. The nature of the yellow snakes of Appoppan Kavu is quite wonderful. Valia Amma is the heart and soul of Mannarasala. The resplendent brightness of Valia Amma has turned into a symbol of Naga deities. Fasting and other austerities continue to mark the worship.

The greenery infuses freshness into any tired soul. The Athirapally Falls joins the Chalakkudy River after a plummeting drop of 80 feet. It provides a tranquil and much needed escape from the troubles and stress of life. The soothing sound takes one to some of nature’s most relaxing places. The charm of the beautiful waterfalls of Athirapally and Vazhachal, pronounced as vaazhachaal, cannot be described in words. Starting calmly from the high ranges and crashing through gorges overhung with trees, these waterfalls are some of the best places in India to re-capture the real sense of the word ‘Picturesque’ not just calm and sweet, but something wild and natural.

                GURUVAYUR SRI KRISHNA TEMPLE is one of the most popular pilgrimage destinations. Legend has it that this idol was originally worshipped by Brahma and gifted to Vishnu who retained it with him at Dwarka during his Krishna Avatar. At the brink of destruction of Dwarka, Krishna instructed Uddhava to seek Vayu and Guru’s help to find a safe haven for the idol. Accordingly, Guru and Vayu installed this idol at Guruvayur, on one side of a lotus lake and on the other side of which was a shrine dedicated to Shiva and Parvathi. It is believed that worshipping here relieves people of physical ailments. It is believed that Janamejaya, son of Parikshit was cured of leprosy upon installing the idol of Krishna and worshipping here. Yet another legend is that a Pandya King was cured of a snake bite while worshipping here. MAMMIYOOR TEMPLE is 2 kms away from Guruvayur.  The temples of Guruvayur and Mammiyoor have an interconnected legend. Lord Shiva, knowing the mission of Guru and Vayu moved a kilometer away to Mammiyoor thus allowing the idol of Sri Krishna to be installed in the sacred place which thereafter came to be known as Guruvayur. It is believed that a pilgrimage to Guruvayur is not complete without worshipping Mammiyoor Mahadeva.

                KOCHI formerly known as Cochin is one of the principal seaports of the country. Heralded as the Queen of Arabian Sea, Kochi was the site of the first European colonial settlement in India. It was occupied by the Portuguese in 1503 and remained the capital of Portuguese India, until 1530, when they opted for Goa as their capital. The city was later occupied by the Dutch and the British. Kochi was the centre of Indian spice trade for many centuries and was known to the  Yavanas,  Greeks as well as Romans, Jews, Arabs and Chinese, since ancient times. St. Francis CSI Church is the oldest European church in India and has great historical significance as a mute witness to the European colonial struggle in the subcontinent. The Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, died in Kochi in 1524 when he was on his third visit to India. His body was originally buried in this Church, but after fourteen years his remains were removed to Lisbon. The Santa Cruz Basilica, a church in Kochi built originally by the Portuguese and elevated to a Cathedral by Pope Paul IV, was spared by the Dutch conquerors who destroyed many Catholic buildings. Later the British demolished the structure and Bishop João Gomes Ferreira commissioned a new building. Santa Cruz Basilica, a Roman Catholic Cathedral is one of the finest and most impressive churches in Kerala. It is a place of devotion as well as a centre of historical significance, endowed with architectural and artistic grandeur and colours of the gothic style.

The name 'Kalady' has a story behind its origin. Once, young Sankara's widowed mother, fainted while on her way to the river Poorna. Sankara prayed fervently to Lord Krishna who answered him saying that the river would originate from the point where Sankara's feet touched the ground. Even today, it can be seen that the river Poorna takes an unusual turn, towards the Sankara Mutt.

Most part of the temple premises is only open land, with a few “Aal thara”. Puja is performed on this foundation. Apart from the spiritual side of Ochira temple, the most interesting concept of this temple is its acceptance of anyone seeking shelter and help. The concept behind this   temple is very simple - God exists everywhere, you seek Him through service, Annadanam. This is the most important offering in Ochira. Uru Nercha devotees also bring in a calf and donate it to the temple, praying for relief from diseases.

All these three Shiva shrines are highly respected and devotees desire to visit all the three of them, on the same day. A giant lamp known as Valia Vilakku stands at the entrance.  This is believed to have been brought here and lit first by the Lord himself.  Devotees first worship this ever-burning lamp by pouring oil in it.  An interesting feature is the Nandi Sacred bull, whose idol gets filled with offerings of paddy is said to contain medicinal properties. Those possessed by witchcraft or black magic who visit this temple for a mandalam i.e. 41 days and offer worship are cured.

The mammoth physique, its intelligence and devotion to the Lord, is legendary. GAJARAJAN KESAVAN was one of the majestic elephants which served the Lord in all its sincerity and uniqueness. He would bend his front legs only before those who held the Lord’s Thidambu, to enable them to climb on him; all others had to climb by his hind legs. He never caused any physical harm to anybody. Even if he became wild outside Guruvayur, he would straightaway come to Guruvayur, go round the temple and stand where he was usually chained.

Due to its coastal location, the town of Tellicherry was a major commercial centre during the British rule of India. They built a seaport in Tellicherry through which a variety of spices such as pepper and cardamom were exported. The square fort, with its massive walls, secret tunnels to the sea, and huge, intricately-carved doors, is an imposing structure. The fort was once the nucleus of Tellicherry’s development.

                Miraculously, the ghee does not melt or emit any smell - ADKKUNATHAN THRISSUR - Here the elegant architectural style that is unique to Kerala is clearly evident. The deity Shiva is in the form of a big 'mahalingam'. Here the main offering is ghee. The devotees bring ghee to pour on the 'lingam'. Offerings over the years have concealed the lingam. At present the devotees can see only a mound of ghee. Miraculously, the ghee does not melt or emit any smell, though in summer the temperature rises upto 35 degree centrigrade. It is said, some part of the ghee is more than 1000 years old. The ghee is not removed. If and when any portion of the mound collapses, the same is sold. If a collapse takes place, it is believed to be a sign of some evil to come in Thrissur. Seven years back there was a partial collapse of ghee prior to the Pooram festival during which three lives were lost in a fireworks accident.

The Goddess in the temple of Attukal is worshipped as the Supreme Mother, creator of all living beings and the mighty preserver as well as destroyer of them all. Pilgrims from all over the country, who visit Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and worship the Lord, do not consider their visits complete without a visit to the shrine of the supreme Mother Attukalamma.The temple is universally famous for the deity Shri Bhagavathy Amman as well as the Pongal festival being conducted here every year. This temple has been listed in Guinness Book of World Records twice for recording the maximum number of people i.e. around 15 lakh to 25 lakh people worshipping in the temple festival conducting the Pongal festival. Due to the congregation of women on the Pongal day, this temple is termed as Women’s Sabarimala. After the burning of Madurai, Kannagi came to this place and rested here. Later her anger got neutralized and she continued to stay here where a temple was built around her. There are many stories about how the Pongal festival came into being. Once the village women working in the field saw a little girl with her feet in the running stream and they approached her to know who she was. She told them that she was hungry and so the women lit a fire in the same place and cooked Pongal for the girl and offered it to her. After eating the Pongal the girl disappeared and the women realized that it was Kannagi herself and from then on they began celebrating the Pongal festival. People who want  a wealthy and peaceful life should visit the temple with family and must take the blessings of Attukkal Bhagavathi Amman.

                PONDICHERRY is a living monument of French culture in India. The town was once upon a time, an abode of scholars well versed in the Vedas. Joseph François Dupleix became the Governor of this French Territory in India. Internal disturbances in Puducherry gave the British, the opportunity to gain control. However, after the Treaty of Paris, the British restored the settlements to the French. French Influence - The design of the city was based on the French grid pattern. (Originally Dutch, the plans of Pondicherry dating from the end of the seventeenth century are preserved in the National Archives at The Hague). The city has many colonial buildings, churches, temples and statues, which, combined with the systematic town planning and the well  planned French style avenues, still preserve much of the colonial ambience. Beaches in Puducherry are Promenade Beach, Paradise Beach, The Auroville Beach and Serenity Beach.  Sri Aurobindo Ashram is one of the best-known and wealthiest ashrams in India. Auroville is meant to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above any creed, politics and nationalities. The heritage buildings and monuments present around the Promenade beach are the Children’s Park & Dupleix Statue, Gandhi statue, Nehru Statue, Le Café, French War Memorial, 19th Century Light House, Bharathi Park, Governor’s Palace, Romain Rolland Library, Legislative Assembly, Puducherry Museum and the French Institute of Pondicherry.

				The French and the British tried to remove the deity from this place and even threw the deity in the sea. But the deity came back to the same place.Peace Of Mind - PONDICHERRY SRI MANAKULA VINAYAGAR TEMPLE was in existence even before the French came and settled in Pondicherry i.e. before 1666. The local people called their God as Manal Kulathu Vinayagar meaning God near the pond of sand. Later it was known as MANAKULA VINAYAGAR. The Jesuits and missionaries tried but could not demolish Manakula Vinayagar temple. The French and the British lived in this part of the town. They made every effort to remove the deity from this place and even threw the deity in the sea but every time they did this, the deity came back to the same place. Later a temple was built near the shores of the Bay of Bengal as per the Ganapathy Agamam and was named Bhuvanesa Vinayagar Temple. Thollaikkathu Siddhar, a saint standing 6ft tall, with broad forehead, glittering blissful eyes, big hole bearing ear, small pot bellied with hand extending up to knee cap and hands with lotus regai, guru medu and sanimedu at a height showing arul gnana regai, got enlightenment from this deity and attained Samadhi in this temple, nearly 300 years ago. From then on, people bring their new born here for worship before going to any other temple. The temple is 300 years old and its early history is marked by trouble, with the French ordering that the annual festival around the streets of Pondicherry should not take place. This caused unrest among the people and 15,000 of them gathered to set off towards Chennai. As they were all workers in a textile factory, the authorities revoked their decision, fearing that work would be affected. This type of incident kept repeating till, strangely, Dupleix, the great French leader himself developed affection for the idol. Such are the winning ways of Lord Vinayaka! who lives in a region bound by sand”. To the Eastern side of the temple lies the sea and the sand. Inside the temple, there is a small pond, which the priest will show to the devotee with the help of a lit camphor. Though the pond is close to the sea, the water is clear. It is believed that anything put into the pond will turn black in colour.

        <div id="collapse52" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading52" data-parent="#accordion">
            <div class="card-body">
                GANGAIKONDA CHOLAPURAM was erected as the capital of the Cholas by Rajendra Chola I, the son and successor of Rajaraja Chola, the great Chola King who conquered a large area in South India at the beginning of the 11th century. His empire included the whole of Southern India up to river Thungabadhra in the north. For administrative and strategic purposes he built another capital and named it Gangaikondacholapuram. The Gangaikondacholapuram Temple he constructed consists of 3 stories and was surrounded by a huge wall like fort. The outer wall was mostly destroyed during the English rule 1896 A.D and the granite rocks were reused  for constructing the Lower Anicut Dam across river Kollidam. Chola rulers were active patrons of arts. They flourished in architecture, education, science, arts, ship construction, poetry, drama, music, commerce and dance. The beautiful Nataraja statue was first conceived during the Chola Empire. Judging from the available literature and from the remains we can conclude, that it was an extensive city, carefully planned and laid in accordance with the architectural treatises to suit the needs of a capital. The city seems to have had two fortifications, inner and outer. The outer was probably wider. The remains of the outer fortification can be seen as a mound running all around the palace. The outer fortification built of burnt bricks, was about six to eight feet wide. It consisted of two walls, the intervening space or the core was filled with sand. The bricks are fairly large in size and were made of well-burnt clay. Systematic brick robbing by the local inhabitants has reduced this structure to its current state. The outer fortification was known as Rajendra Chola Madil and is mentioned in the inscriptions. The inner fortification was around the royal palace, probably identical with the Utpadi Vittu Madil of the inscriptions. Kulothunga Chola I also built a sculptural temple at Melakadambur, which is a wonderful masterpiece of Chola art. By the 13th century, the Chola kingdom had exhausted its resources and was on the decline. It succumbed to an attack by the Hoysalas from the west and the Pandyas from the south. The Chola administration served as a model for all the other kingdoms of the South. The king had a Council of Ministers. The kingdom was divided into a number of provinces known as Mandalams; the mandalams in turn were divided into Valanadu and Nadus. The next administrative sub divisions were kurrams and kottams. The special feature of the Chola administration was the Local Self Government or autonomous administration. The villagers themselves carried out village administration. It was more or less like the modern day Panchayat Raj. Each village had a village assembly known as the Ur or the sabha. The members of the sabha were elected by lots, known as Kudavolai system. There was a committee to look after the specified departments, such as justice, law and  order, irrigation etc., which were called as variyams. The Temple of Gangaikondacholisvara, the great Vimana arrests the visitor's sight. As it rises to a height of 182 feet and is shorter than the Thanjavur tower with larger plinth, it is often described as the feminine counterpart of the Thanjavur temple. The Gangaikondacholapuram Vimana is undoubtedly a Devalaya Chakravarti, an emperor among temples of South India. The royal palace was also built of burnt bricks. The ceilings were covered with flat tiles of small size, laid in a number of courses, in fine lime mortar. The pillars were probably made of polished wood, supported on granite bases. A few pillar bases have survived to this day. Iron nails and clamps have been recovered from this palace site. There is an underground tunnel that links the palace and the inner temple. It is likely that there was more than one royal building each having its own name and must have been a splendid site. Besides the names of the palace and fort walls, the names of a few roads and streets are preserved in the epigraphs. There were both wet and dry lands inside the Fort, used for cultivation and other purposes. The present position of the existing temples throws some light on the lay out of the city. The great temple and other temples have been erected, with the palace at the centre of the city. Towards the northeast Isanya of the palace, is the great temple of Shiva which according to Vastu and traditional texts, should be in the north -east side of the city or village and should face east. The capital of the most powerful empire in Asia at one time now lies deserted, only the temple of Gangaikondachola survives in GangaiKondaCholapuram. What caused the destruction of this city? - The Pandyas who put an end to the Chola Empire late in the 13th century, took revenge for their earlier defeats, and razed the city to the ground, a misfortune that befell capitals in the bygone ages. It remained a mountain of brick debris. The inhabitants of the nearby villages stole the bricks for their own construction. The people have also dug systematically deep into the ground and extracted cartloads of ancient bricks.

               DARASURAM -The emblem of the Chola Empire was the tiger, which was featured on the Chola flag, coins and in other contexts of political significance. The sanctum is  in the form of a chariot. This temple is a storehouse of art and architecture. The vimana is 85 feet high. The front mandapam itself is in the form of a huge chariot drawn by horses. The temple has some exquisite stone carvings. The Great Living Chola Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site at Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Darasuram were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries and have a lot of similarities. Legend has it that Airavata, the white elephant of Indra, worshipped Lord Siva in this temple, as also did Yama, the King of Death. It is said that the presiding deity Airavateswarar cured Yama who was suffering under a Rishi's curse from a burning sensation all over the body. Yama took a bath in the sacred tank and was rid of the burning sensation. Since then the tank is known as Yamateertham. In the recent past Raja Raja Chola and Karikala Chola worshipped the Shiva Lingam in this temple.  As originally Airavata worshipped the Lingam, the Lingam is named after him as Airavateswara. The carvings contain different poses of gymnastic feats seen in the modern circus, shown by females keeping their head at the centre and legs interwoven in such a skillful way as to form the circumference of a circle. It may be a depiction of the present-day gypsy tribe entertaining villagers with gymnastic shows and dancing poses. Such gypsies are still to be seen visiting the remote villages of the country. Many styles of physical feats shown by both men and women have been carved in the stones. With heavily ornamented pillars, accurate in detail and richly sculpted walls, the Airavateswara temple at Darasuram is a classic example of Chola art and architecture. The main mantapa is called Raja Gambira, as the elephant draws the chariot. The ceiling has a beautiful carving of Shiva and Parvathi inside an open lotus. All the dancing poses of Bharatanatyam are carved in the stone. There is a carving showing the village womenfolk helping in the delivery of another female, who has both her hands on the shoulders of the two ladies, who are pressing their hands on the abdomen  of the lady to help her deliver. 'These are very skillful and artistic works of superb style and give a glimpse into the social conditions of the past. The stone image of Ravana carrying Kailas, Buddha, Bhikshatana, Saraswathi without her Veena, and a sculpture of Ardhanarishwara, Brahma and Surya are fine specimens of workmanship.  At the entrance to the temple, two Dwarapalakas, Sankhanidhi and Padmanidhi are imposing figures, giving vivid anatomical expressions of the exuberance of youth. In front of the temple, there is a small mandapa, which can be reached by three steps in the form of a ladder. The steps are stones, which give different musical sounds when tapped. All the seven swaras can be heard at different points. HOGENAKKAL FALLS is a waterfall in South India on the Kaveri river. Hailed as the “Niagara Falls of India”, it is famous for its medicinal baths and fun boat rides. Carbonatite rocks in this site are considered to be the oldest of its kind, not just in South Asia but also in the world. The Kaveri river at Hogenakkal drops and creates numerous waterfalls as the water cuts through the rocky terrain. The water falls are as much as 20 metres high and fall with a thunderous sound.  Here the water spreads for miles around. The area is surrounded by hills and offers a lovely panoramic view. People can take bath in the Kaveri river, before and beyond the falls. Before reaching Hogenakkal, the river flows through a forest which contains herbs that are traditionally believed to enhance health. Hence, bathing in these waters is believed to be curative. Boating in Hogenakkal is allowed during the dry-season as the water falls are not strong and treacherous to disrupt the passage of the boats.  The coracles are about 2.24 metres in diameter and are steered using a single paddle, making them unique. Freshly caught fish are sold at the side of the gorge.

                PILLAIYAR PATTI GANESHA TEMPLE - This is an ancient rock-cut cave shrine dedicated to Ganesha. A 6 feet Karpaga Vinayaga has been carved inside. As this is a cave formation, there is no provision to go around for the pradakshina. The Thumbikai or trunk of Lord Pillaiyar is curled towards his right side and so the God is also known as Valampuri Pillaiyar, which is also a unique feature. Lord Karpaga Vinayagar is seated facing the northern side. In view of this, those who pray to him get more and more success. The Chettiyar and Nagarathar community are doing an outstanding job in maintaining the temple. Chettiars have animal instinct.  Whenever they sense that there will be flood and famine they leave that place and migrate to another kingdom. They were welcomed by Kings because of their skills in business and as they were rich.  Even now Chettiars are the only community whose subcastes are  divided, based on Shiva Temples. Just like the Karpaga Tree, Lord Karpaga Vinayaga grants all blessings to the World. There are only two Vinayagas with two hands. One is at Pillaiyarpatti and the other is in Afghanisthan. The age of the cave temple here is more than 2500 years or more. From the history of divine architecture, from the stone sculptures and from available documentary evidences, Pillaiyarpatti Pillaiyar idol is the first Pillaiyar Ganesha  in the world.

                The Ariyaman beach in between Ramanathapuram and Rameswaram ‘FUN’TASTIC LOCATION - Tourists enjoy the gentle waves at the Ariyaman beach near Ramanathapuram and Rameswaram. This fine beach is 30 kms before Rameswaram and 30 kms from Ramanathapuram, located in the connecting the two important towns. The Ariyaman beach, a neat location on the side of Palk Bay, has turned out to be a much sought after picnic destination. Though the district has been blessed with few good beaches, including the one at Sangumal and another at Muhunthrayarchathiram, it is Ariyaman beach which attracts huge crowd of locals on a daily basis, particularly on holidays and during festivals. Adding to the beauty of the Ariyaman beach is the calm waters of Palk Bay. The gentle waves with a steady breeze fascinate holiday makers. The beach, which measures nearly 150 meters wide, extends to a stretch of about 2 Kms and  boasts of a good environment for tourists to enjoy nature. The existing casuarina plantation of 50 metres width and 2 kms stretch at the entrance of the beach also add to its glamour and its shade is a great boon for visitors to sit and take rest from the scorching sun. The real beauty lies in the calmness of the place with no human interference. Just the sound of breeze and blue waves kissing the white sand, can easily capture one’s imagination. RAMESWARAM - The biggest and the toughest construction in Indian history of bridges is the Pamban Bridge - One will be awestruck by its huge gigantic appearance. Gandamadana Parvatham Ramarpadham - On the way to Dhanushkodi, this is the place where Sri Ram rested during his efforts to regain Sita. There is a chakra where his foot prints are imprinted. The temple being on a hill top, gives a complete view of the whole land. It has a fantastic view with waters, land mass, with the sand and sky overlapping one another. Dhanuskodi can be reached by a heavy duty mini truck colloquially called as “meen body vandi” in Tamil. The travel in the sea sand for about 5 kms is exciting. No roads are present. The people lay tire marks over the sand. Every vehicle passing has to follow the track mark. Slipping an inch would lock the vehicle in sand. The route is of great interest to bird watchers as there are lots of birds flying around. This was a flourishing place during the British rule in India and continued to be so, even after 15 years, post independence. There were railway stations, schools, churches and everything that one needed to live a peaceful life and one of the most favourite – sea and sand to laze around. This place was completely destroyed, by Nature’s fury, in 1964. The Tsunami swallowed the whole land, and everything was swept away.

                Ramanatha Swamy Temple, RAMESWARAM - The 22 theerthams within the Ramanatha Samy temple complex are believed to have particular powers and the taste of the water of each well is different from the other. According to legend, Lord Rama built a bridge the Ram Setu, also known as Adam’s Bridge, across the sea to Lanka to rescue his consort Sita, from her abductor, Ravana. Former President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, hails from a fishing hamlet in this island. Pilgrimage to Rameswaram is as significant for the Hindus as a pilgrimage to Varanasi - It has one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. Upon the advice of Rishis, Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana, installed and worshipped the Sivalinga here to expiate the sin of Brahmahatya - killing of a Brahmin - Ravana.The grandest part of the temple is the 1219 metres pillared corridor consisting of 3.6 metres high granite pillars, richly carved and well proportioned and run uninterruptedly, to a length of nearly 230 metres.

               VELANKANNI - Once a port that traded with Rome and Greece.  Velankanni Church is an important Roman Catholic shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Good Health. Portuguese sailors who escaped from a severe cyclone, built the 24 feet by 12 feet chapel, with a dome overhead. They also brought porcelain plates, which can be seen illustrating biblical scenes and other cultural arts of the time. The main statue that they had brought to the altar of the Shrine was Our Lady holding the Baby Jesus, standing majestically on the globe. Velankanni is attributed to three miracles, the apparition of Mary and the Christ Child to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor and the rescue of Portuguese sailors from a violent sea storm. Holy masses are conducted in at least eight languages, Tamil, English, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Konkani, Hindi and Marathi. Velankanni Church is considered a very powerful holy place in India where one is cured of any ailment when one offers prayers with a true heart. Devotees often offer gifts made of gold or silver for cure of sickness.

                PANCHKUYAN MANDIR, Madhya Pradesh - This is a very famous Hanuman Mandir called Panchkuyan Hanuman Mandir. The specialty of the temple is that there are thousands of parrots that can be found inside the mandir. Every day people provide them with tonnes and tonnes of the feeds-dhanyam. It can be seen that before feeding, the parrots would first see the statue of Hanuman and then start eating them. This is seen as the bhakti of parrots towards Hanuman.

               AJMER - A place of Muslim pilgrimage is situated at the foot of the Ajajmeru Hill. The last Hindu ruler was defeated by Mohammed Ghori here. A favourite residence of the great Moghuls, Ajmer, is also one of the first places of contact between the Moghuls and the British. Sir Thomas Roe met Jehangir here in 1616. The main places of interest are the Dargāh, tomb of the most revered Muslim sufi saint Muinniddhin Chishtī, known as Gharīb Nawāz, or the ‘Benefactor of the Poor’. Taragarh Fort at  Ajmer is claimed to be the first hill fort of Asia, one of the oldest hill forts of the world. It is approached by steep and very roughly paved slopes. Ajmer is also just a stepping stone to nearby Pushkar, famous for the Pushkar Lake & Brahma temple , the godhead of the Hindu Pantheon and Creator of the universe. This is the most celebrated site for the worship of Brahma. Pushkar is also famous for its annual Pushkar Camel Fair during November.

The magnificent fort and imposing temples made of red and yellow sandstone, display some of the finest creations of the Rajputs. The Karni Mata Temple, is a temple where pilgrims worship thousands of holy rats.

                JAISALMER Fort & Palaces. Nowhere else in India is a place remotely similar to Jaisalmer. Yet this desert fortress is straight out of the tales of the Arabian Nights and one could easily be forgiven for imagining that he or she has been transported back to medieval Afghanistan.  Magical, incomparably romantic and totally unspoiled, this city has been nicknamed the ‘Golden City’. People have built magnificent houses and mansions, all exquisitely carved from wood and from golden-yellow sandstone.  While these can be found elsewhere in Rajasthan, nowhere are they quite as exotic, as in Jaisalmer.   On a hill, overlooking the town lies the Fort, in the heart of the Thar Desert . Camel safaris through the nearby desert, and a few quiet days spent wandering around the town and the surrounding desert could be a wonderful way of relaxing. Jaisalmer Fort’s massive sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day which turns to a magical honey-gold as the sun sets. It is a living fort. Patwon-ki-Haveli, with its ornate five-storey complex, is the largest, the most magnificent and the most elaborate of the Jaisalmer havelis. Salam Singh-ki-Haveli has a beautifully arched roof capped with blue cupolas and carved brackets in the form of peacocks. Nathmalji-ki-Haveli facade is a riot of ornamentation with flowers, birds, elephants, soldiers, a bicycle and even a steam engine.

               UDAIPUR - The very word Udaipur evokes memories of warriors warding off the mighty Mughals. It was here that Maharana Pratap kept his historic tryst with Emperor Akbar. It was here that Rani Padmini preferred “Jauhar”and walked alive into a flaming pyre than be subjected to any indignity by the invaders. Meera, the royal poetess and worshipper of Lord Krishna, was born here. Udaipur is a city of shimmering lakes, rugged hills and embattlements, in the shape of palaces, both big and small. The City Palace and its imposing octagonal towers surmounted by cupolas, add excellence to the architecture. At every step, there is a hoary relic, comparable in  magnificence to the Windsor Palace at United Kingdom. Zenana Mahal is a romantic palace, possessive of their womenfolk. The Kings had it built as an impregnable fortress without even a window.   Lake Palace as the name implies, is a palace set amidst the lake - Pichola. The Maharana Pratap Memorial on an elevated platform is an imposing statue of the Maharana, in bronze alloy astride his favourite horse “Chetak”. Lake Fateh Sagar north of Lake Pichola, overlooks a number of hills and parks. Jag Mandir here is an island palace.

                AGRA Wonder of the World, the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort. The chosen city of the Mughal emperors, during the early years of the Moghul period.  It was here that the founder of the dynasty, Babur, laid out the first formal Persian Garden on the banks of the river Yamuna. Taj Mahal - If there’s a building which represents a country, like the Eiffel Tower for France, the Sydney Opera House for Australia, then it has to be the Taj Mahal for India. This the most famous Moghul monument was constructed by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the ‘Lady of the Taj’.  It has been described as the most extravagant monument ever built for love, by the emperor, who was heartbroken when Mumtaz, to whom he had been married for 17 years, died in 1629, during childbirth, after producing 14 children. The Taj Mahal stands serene and perfect in its garden of cypresses and reflecting pools on the banks of the river Yamuna.  Its pure white marble shimmers like silver in the moonlight glows softly in pink at dawn and at the close of day, reflects the fiery tints of the setting sun.  The Taj in all its timeless beauty continues to inspire poets, painters, writers and photographers.  Lovers still meet here in the moonlight in the shadow of the world’s most famous monument of love.  During the reign of the Moghuls, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Agra was the capital of India, and its superb monuments, dates from that era. Agra Fort has a magnificent fort and building. Construction of the massive Agra Fort was begun by Emperor Akbar and additions were made till the time of his grandson, Shah Jahan.  During Akbar’s time, the fort was principally a military structure and by Shah Jahan’s time it had become partially a palace. There are many fascinating buildings inside the massive walls. Fatehpūr Sikrī - the Mughal Emperor Akbar built Fatehpūr Sikrī and shifted his capital there. An inscription on the central face of the Buland Darwāza demonstrates Akbar’s religious broad mindedness. It has a message from Jesus advising his followers not to consider this world as their permanent home.

                VARANASI an ancient city and a centre of learning for over 2000 years. Varanasi is the holiest of pilgrimage places located on the banks of the river Ganga.  It is also commonly known as Banaras.   Considered as the centre of earth in Hindu Cosmology, every Hindu is expected to visit this holy place at least once in a lifetime and if possible pour the remains or ashes of cremated ancestors here.   Varanasi is one of the oldest inhabitated cities in the world and probably the oldest city of India. American writer Mark Twain wrote “Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.” According to legend, the city was founded by the  Hindu deity, Lord Shiva, around 5,000 years ago. Varanasi was a commercial and industrial centre, famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. It has the holy shrine of Kashi Vishwanath and it is also one of the twelve revered Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. Hindus believe that bathing in the river Ganges remits sins and that dying in Kashi ensures release of a person's soul from the cycle of its transmigrations. Varanasi is one of the holiest places in Buddhism too, being one of the four pilgrimage sites said to have been designated by Gautama Buddha.  At Sarnath Gautama Buddha is said to have given his first sermon about the basic principles of Buddhism.  Ghats - Varanasi's principal attraction is the long string of bathing Ghats which line the west bank of the Ganges.  Ghats are the steps which lead down to the river, and houses two burning Ghats, where bodies are cremated. Great Mosque of Aurangzeb - It has been constructed using columns from the Biseswar Temple razed by Aurangzeb. Durga Temple is commonly known as the Monkey temple due to the number of monkeys that have made it their home. Tulsi Manas Temple - Famous medieval age poet and author, Tulsi Das, lived here. Benares Hindu University The Bharat Kala Bhavan at the university has a fine collection of miniature paintings and sculptures from the 1st to 15th centuries. Alamgir Mosque Locally known as Beni Madhav Ka Darera, this was originally a Vishnu temple erected by the Maratha Chieftain Beni Madhav Rao Scindia. Aurangzeb destroyed it and erected a mosque in its place, but it is a curious Hindu- Muslim mixture with the lower portion of the structure, entirely Hindu.

                DEHRADUN  Shivalik Hills is in the south, the river Ganga is in the east, and the river Yamuna is in the west. Rivers, Ganga and Yamuna, divide and pass through the city. Budha Temple & Clementown Park, Malsi Deer Park, Sahastradhara, Tapkeshwar Shiva Temple, Robber’s Cave, Lachhiwala and Maldevta are some of the sightseeing places of this hill station. HARIDWAR is an important pilgrimage city. The river Ganga, flowing for 253 kilometres from its source at Gaumukh, at the edge of the Gangotri Glacier, enters the  plains, at Haridwar. Regarded as one of the seven holiest places of Hindus.  Haridwar along with Ujjain, Nasik and Allahabad is one of the four sites where drops of Amrit, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher, while being carried by the celestial bird, Garuda. This has manifested in the Kumbha Mela being celebrated every 3 years in one of the 4 places, and thus every 12 years in Haridwar. At the Kumbha Mela, millions of pilgrims, devotees and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the river Ganga to wash away their sins to attain Moksha. Brahma Kund, the spot where the Amrit fell, is located at Har ki Pauri, literally, “footsteps of the Lord” and is considered to be the most sacred ghat of Haridwar. The evening prayer and Aarti at dusk offered to Goddess Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri on the steps of God Hara or Shiva is an enchanting experience. A spectacle of sound and colour is seen when, after the ceremony, pilgrims float diyas, floral floats with lamps and incense on the river, commemorating their deceased ancestors. Thousands of people from all round the world make it a point to attend this prayer on their visit to Haridwar.

                RISHIKESH in Sanskrit is a name of Lord Vishnu which means ‘Lord of the Senses’. The place gets its name after Lord Vishnu who appeared to ‘Raibhya Rishi’ as a result of his tapasya, austerities, as Lord Rishikesh. The home of Sivananda Ashram and the Divine Life Society founded by Swami Sivananda is situated to the north of Rishikesh. The Ganga Arati is performed at dusk at the Triveni Ghat. ‘Neelkanth Mahadev Temple’, set amidst forests, along with ‘Vasishtha Gufa, Cave of sage Vasishtha, can be visited from Rishikesh. Legends state, that Lord Rama performed penance here for killing Ravana, the demon King of Lanka, and Lakshmana, his younger brother, crossed the river Ganga, at a point, where the present ‘Lakshman Jhula’  bridge stands today, using a jute rope bridge. The sacred river Ganga  flows through Rishikesh. It is here that the river leaves the Shivalik mountains in the Himalayas and flows out into the plains of northern India. Rishikesh, sometimes nicknamed “the world capital of Yoga”, has numerous yoga centres. It is believed that meditation in Rishikesh brings one, closer to attainment of moksha, as does a dip in the holy river that flows through it. Rishikesh is also home to the 120-year old Kailas Ashram Brahmavidyapeetham, an institution dedicated to preserve and promote the traditional Vedantic studies. Swami Vivekananda, Swami Rama Tirtha and Swami Shivananda, have studied in this institution.

                ELLORA & AJANTA - ELLORA CAVES- Daulatabad, Rauza - With its countless number of historical figures, caves, sculptures and paintings, Ellora represents the epitome of Indian rock-cut architecture. The 34 “caves” are actually structures, excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills. It was initially thought that the Buddhist caves were one of the earliest structures, created between the fifth and the eighth centuries, but now it is clear to the modern scholars that some of the Hindu caves precede them. The ceilings are carved to give the impression of wooden beams. The construction of this cave was a feat of human genius. It entailed removal of 200,000 tonnes of rock which took 100 years to complete.The AJANTA CAVES are 31 rock-cut cave monuments, containing paintings and sculptures considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This cave has one of the most elaborate carvings on its facade with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. Paintings are all over the cave except for the floor. At various places the art work has eroded due to decay and human interference. The technique and process used to produce this kind of artwork is different and very unique, unlike any other artwork found in the art history of other civilizations.
